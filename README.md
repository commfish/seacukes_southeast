exploratory work on sea cucumber density and variance

Sea cucumbers in southeast alaska are survied in a dive survey with replicate transects.  The number or count of sea cucumbers is recorded, and a subsample of these are collected for weights.  
Raw data (that is available) are average counts of invidivuals in each transect in each year.  Counts are averaged between two divers so may not be whole numbers.
